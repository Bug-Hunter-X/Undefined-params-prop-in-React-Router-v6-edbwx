This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useParams` hook in React Router v6. The error arises from an incorrect usage of the hook, leading to an undefined `params` prop in the component that requires route parameters.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code where the `useParams` hook is not correctly integrated. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected implementation.

This simple example helps illustrate the correct usage of the `useParams` hook to avoid unexpected errors and undefined prop issues.
